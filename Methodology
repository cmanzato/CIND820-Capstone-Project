The overall tentative methodology displays the process of work being completed throughout the course of the project. 
Portions of the overall tentative methodology were updated based on feedback, obstacles encountered, and further progress being made on the overall project. 
The following is a table for the overall tentative methodology:

Step 1: Choose theme
The theme I chose was classification and regression. 
Step 2: Choose dataset
I chose the Student Performance dataset. 
Step 3: Abstract 
Wrote an abstract for the Big Data Analytics project. Includes research questions. 
-updated the research questions and abstract to better suit the project as needed
Step 4: Literature Review
Wrote a literature review describing my research for the project.
-updated the descriptive analytics and made it more detailed
Step 5: Coding in R Studio 
Writing the code to get the classification and regression algorithms. 
-cleaning and preparing the dataset for the models/algorithms
-manipulating columns in the dataset to better suit the models
-normalizing data and performing train-test splits
-writing code for the regression model and decision tree
-calculating the accuracy, precision and recall for the regression model and decision tree
-writing code for random forest model 
-calculating accuracy and making confusion matrix
-finding which attributes have the greatest impact on the random forest model
Step 5.1: Uploading technical reports 
Uploading the technical reports on GitHub.
-reuploaded code and models as needed
Step 5.2: Uploading the working database
Uploading the working database on GitHub. 
Step 6: The final report
Writing the final report that includes: updated research questions, analyses, project findings, and shortcomings. 
Step 7: Final presentation 
Presenting the project and explaining what was completed.
